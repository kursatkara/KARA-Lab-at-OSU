Welcome to KARA Lab!

I am the principal investigator of the **K**ara **A**erodynamics **R**ese**a**rch **Lab**oratory at Oklahoma State University (KARA Lab)

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University, a position that I hold since August 2019.

I completed my Ph.D. at Old Dominion University in the Department of Aerospace Engineering with Dr. P. Balakumar and Prof. O. Kandil in 2008. My dissertation was on hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity to acoustic disturbances over cones. Following graduation, I worked as an Aerodynamics/CFD Engineer at New England Analytics LLC, a consulting company for the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. After that, I joined the Aerospace Engineering Department at Penn State as a post-doc and worked with Prof. Philip J. Morris on supersonic hot jet simulations for aeroacoustics. Later, I joined the Aerospace Engineering Department at Khalifa University as a founding faculty. My research interests include: Hypersonic Flows, Boundary-Layer Transition, Computational Aerodynamics, Quantum Computing, Flow Separation Control, Sweeping Jet Actuator.
