Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an essential role in designing flight vehicles. It provides detailed, accurate airflow predictions about aircraft, and it is a cost-effective alternative to expensive wind tunnel testing. However, high-resolution CFD simulations of complex flows can take weeks or more to complete with existing supercomputers. Finding ways to speed up CFD simulations is a perennial problem.

Quantum algorithms can speed up many significant, computationally challenging problems when run on a quantum computer. The best-known example is Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm, which exponentially speeds up over the best classical factoring algorithms. Consequently, it has dramatically impacted state-of-the-art cryptography.

It is natural to ask whether a quantum computer might allow a speedup of CFD simulations. In this project, we apply the quantum PDE algorithm to governing equations of fluid dynamics such as Navier-Stokes, Burgers’, and Heat Transfer equations.
