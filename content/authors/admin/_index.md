Kursat Kara is the principal investigator of the Kara Aerodynamics Research Laboratory at Oklahoma State University. He teaches Fundamentals of Aerodynamics, Unsteady Aerodynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and Quantum Computing. Previously, he was an assistant professor at Khalifa University, where he received the President's Faculty Excellence Award for Outstanding Teaching in 2015.

Dr. Kara earned his Ph.D. from Old Dominion University, focusing on hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity to acoustic disturbances over cones. After graduation, he worked as a research engineer at New England Analytics LLC, a consulting firm for Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. He then joined Penn State's Aerospace Engineering Department as a post-doc, collaborating with Prof. Philip J. Morris on supersonic hot jet simulations for aeroacoustics. In 2010, he became a founding faculty member of the Aerospace Engineering Department at Khalifa University. In August 2019, he joined Oklahoma State University.

Dr. Kara is a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the American Physical Society (APS). He served on the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee (APATC) from 2012 to 2021, including its Membership and Education subcommittees during that time.
