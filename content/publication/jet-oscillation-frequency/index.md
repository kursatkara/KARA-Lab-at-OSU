abstract: The time-resolved flow field of a spatially oscillating jet emitted by a sweeping jet (SWJ) actuator is investigated numerically using three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (3D-URANS) equations. Numerical simulations are performed for a range of mass flow rates providing flow conditions varying from incompressible to subsonic compressible flows. After a detailed mesh study, the computational domain is represented using two million hexagonal control volumes. The jet oscillation frequency is predicted by analyzing velocity time histories at the actuator exit. A linear relationship between the jet oscillation frequency and time-averaged exit nozzle Mach number is found ( f= 511.22 M + 46.618 , R² = 0.97). The results of our numerical model are compared with data from the literature, and a good agreement is observed. In addition, we confirmed that the Strouhal number is almost constant with the Mach number for the subsonic oscillating jet and has an average value of St = 0.0131. The 3D-URANS model presented here provides a computationally inexpensive yet accurate alternative to the researchers investigating jet oscillation characteristics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The jet oscillation frequency is predicted by analyzing velocity time histories at the actuator exit. A linear relationship between the jet oscillation frequency and time-averaged exit nozzle Mach number is found. We calculated the Strouhal number and founds that it is constant with the Mach number for the subsonic oscillating jet and has an average value of St = 0.0131.
