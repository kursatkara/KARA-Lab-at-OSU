abstract: In the present study, we numerically tested the performance of a Sweeping Jet (SWJ) actuator on flow-separation control using two-dimensional unsteady RANS (URANS) simulations over a NASA wall-mounted hump model. The SWJ actuator was integrated into the hump model at the upstream separation point (65% of the chord) and angled 30-deg to the freestream direction. We studied the interaction of the oscillating jet in this orientation with freestream and separation bubble. The SWJ actuator reduced the separation bubble size in all cases, and the reattachment point moved upstream by 41%.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
